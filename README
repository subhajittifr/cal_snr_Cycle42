To use the code:
1. Create a data file following the samples.txt
2. Run the command $python3 cal.snr.py <input-file-name> 
	In this case samples.txt is the input file name, you must use the file you have created in the place of second argument in the code.
3. You can just run $python3 cal.snr.py , to see how to use it.
